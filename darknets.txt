Software used for bypassing censorship (maintaining privacy):

        OpenVpn - Usage of VPN limit's info leading to your actions online including connections to teh darknet, though connection to a vpn may cause suspicion and may be blocked in the same way

Software used for combating surveillance (maintaining anonymity):

        Tor Browser - Most popular darknet..known for being the most effective software (to date) in anonymitizing information when used correctly. It is compatible for use with the clearnet as well as sites within the Tor darknet "onion site", which are themselves anonymous and only communicate anonymously.

        I2P - Second most popular darknet..known for having a more decentralized approach toward anonymity. Every user of the network contributes bandwidth (there are no central nodes \o/ ).Outproxying is available to the clearnet and even the tor network, but most activity goes on within the I2P network itself (thus it is more difficult to spy on).I2P uses garlic routing in contrast to Tor's onion routing, and it has sites similar to ".onion"'s these are called eepsites.

        Freenet - A peer-to-peer anonymous network which is end-to-end encrypted. All users contribute to the network by sharing bandwith and hard drive space(files are/can be encrypted), so even if one is responsible for it's contents they will not be held responsible(hopefully).Popular in Asia(mainly China) and many countries in the middle east. There have been reported attacks against the network by authorities(just like all other darknets), through a specific process where they have acted as "peers" and intercepted data. Because of this there is a trust system that allows connections only to people you trust.

        GnuNet -
