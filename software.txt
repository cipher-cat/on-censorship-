Software used for bypassying censorship mostly (maintaining privacy):

OpenVpn - Usage of VPN limit's info leading to your actions online including connections to teh darknet, though connection to a vpn may cause suspition and may be blocked the same way

Software used for combating surveilance (maintaining anonymity):

Tor Browser - Most popular anonymous network..known for being the most effective software (to date) in anonymitizing information when used correctly.It is compatible for use with the clearnet as well as sites within the Tor darknet "onion site", which are themselves anonymous and only communicate anonymously.

I2P - Probably the seccond most popular anonymous software..known for a more decentralized approach torward anonymity.Every user of the network makes contributes bandwith (there are no central nodes \o/ ).Outproxying is available to the clearnet and even the tor network, but most activity goes on within the I2P network itself (thus it is more difficult to spy on).Sites in the I2P darknet are known as eepsites, and communications are end-to-end encrypted.

Freenet - A peer-to-peer anonymous network which is end-to-end encrypted.All users contribute to the network by sharing bandwith and hard drive space(files are/can be encrypted), so even if one is responsible for it's contents they will not be held responsible(hopefully).Popular in Asia(mainly China) and many countries in the middle east.There have been reported attacks against the network by authorities(just like all other darknets), through a specific process where they have acted as "peers" and intercepted data.Because of this there is a trust system that allows connections only to people you trust.
